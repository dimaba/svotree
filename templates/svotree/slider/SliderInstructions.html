    <p>
        In this task, imagine that you have been randomly paired with another person,
        whom we will refer to as <strong>the other</strong>. This other person is someone you do not
        know and will remain mutually anonymous. All of your choices are
        completely confidential.<br>
        You will be making a series of decisions about allocating resources between you
        and this other person. For each of the following questions, please indicate the
        distribution you prefer most by <strong>moving the slider along the scale
        to your preferred payoff allocation</strong>.<br>
        You can only make one selection for each question. Your decisions
        will yield money for both yourself and the other person.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are no right or wrong answers, this is all about personal preferences. After you have made
        your decision, <strong>make it final by pressing the Confirm button to the right of the scale.</strong>
        As you can see, your choices will influence both the amount of points you receive and the
        amount of points the other receives.
